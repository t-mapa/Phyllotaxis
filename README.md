# Phyllotaxis

## Drawing flowers using Math. Using R's graphical power to produce artistic images such as phyllotaxis--the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem.

- Drew 50 points on a circle of radius 1 using the Pythagorean trigonometric identity which states that sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1 for any real number θ
- Arranged points in a spiral by multiplying x and y by a factor which increases for each point, through the use of the Golden Angle
- Modified color, transparency, size, and angle of the points to make the image more appealing
